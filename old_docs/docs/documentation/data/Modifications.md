# Modifications

The usage of `@variable_modifications` allows for variables to be dynamically modified when retrieved, with a particular focus on accumulation and other aggregations.

## Definitions

The distinction between `Transforms` & `Modifications` can be considered as follows

- A `Transform` operates on a given data object seperate to its source. It introduces no new information, but simply 'transforms' the information already contained. For example, a region subset, or even an aggregation over the spatial dimensions.
- A `Modification` operates on a data object with access to its source. It can thereby introduce new information, and modifies the meaning of a variable. For example, altering `tcwv` to be the accumulated `tcwv` over a length of time.

## Usage

By decorating an archive with `@pyearthtools.data.decorators.variable_modifications()` modifications can be applied on a variable level.

```python
class Archive(ArchiveIndex):
    @variable_modifications(variable_keyword = 'variable')
    def __init__(self, variable):
        ...
```

When specifying the variables, the modification syntax can be used

```!MODIFICATION[KWARGS]:VARIABLE>NEWNAME```

Where, `MODIFICATION` references the modification name, `KWARGS` contains the parameters needed for the modification in json form, and `VARIABLE` is the variable name as would be used normally and with anything after `>` being the new name, which can be ommited.

Or dictionary with following keys

```text
    - source_var (REQUIRED)     Variable to modify
    - modification (REQUIRED)   Modification to apply
    - target_var                Rename of variable
    - **                        Any other keys for `modification`
```

```python
Archive('!accumulate[period = "6 hourly"]:tcwv)
```

or

```python
Archive(variable = ['!accumulate[period = "6 hourly"]:tcwv', '2t'])
```

or

```python
Archive(variable = {'source_var':'tcwv','modification':'accumulate', 'target_var':'accum_tcwv', 'period':"6 hours"})
```


## Custom

A user can provide custom modifications accessible in the exact same way to the user,

Using `@register_modification` around a Modification subclass, with the only arg being the name accessible underneath,

```python
@register_modification("aggregate")
class AggregationGeneral(Aggregation):
    ...
```

`single` and `series` will need to be implemented by the user containing the functionality to calculate the modification for single time and a series of times dataset's.


`single` takes a single timestep and expects a dataset to be returned with the variable as modified.

`series` takes a start, end and interval, as can be parsed by `pyearthtools.data.TimeRange`, and expects 
a dataset to be returned with the variable as modified but all timesteps as defined by the range.

`variable` contains the variable being modified.

`data` contains the `TimeDataIndex` to retrieve the data from.

`attribute_update` can be overridden to specify a dictionary to update the attributes with.
