# PyEarthTools: Reproducible machine learning for Earth system science

PyEarthTools is a Python framework, containing modules for loading data; pre-processing, normalising and standardising data; defining machine learning (ML) models; training ML models; performing inference with ML models; and evaluating ML models. It contains specialised support for weather and climate data sources and models. It has an emphasis on reproducibility, shareable pipelines, and human-readable low-code pipeline definition.

> [!NOTE]
> **THIS REPOSITORY IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

> This repository contains code which is under construction, and should not yet be used outside of a research setting.
> The development team are working busily to bring everything up to spec. As such, things are likely

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which can be used individually or together.

|    Sub-Package  |  Purpose  |
|-----------------|---------------------- |
|  [Data](./data/data_index.md)    | Loading and indexing into well-known Earth system data sets to produce ML-ready data structures |
|  Utils          | Code for common functionality across the sub-packages |
|  Pipeline       | Definining reproducible sequences of operations with the ability to cache results |
|  Training       | Code defining the training processes and schedules of a machine learning model |
|  Tutorial       | Contains helper code for data data sets used in tutorials |
|  Bundled Models | Maintained versions of specific, bundled models which can be easily trained and run |
|  Zoo            | Contains code for managing registered models (such as the bundled models) |
|  Evaluation     | (Coming soon) Contains code for producing standard evaluations (such as benchmarks and scorecards) |
