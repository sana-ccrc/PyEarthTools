# PyEarthTools: Machine learning for Earth system science

- An approachable way for researchers to get started with ML research for Earth system science
- Provides a software framework for research and experimentation
- Also suitable for students and newcomers
- Still under early-stage development - things are likely to change a lot. If you notice an issue, please feel free to raise it on GitHub

## Installation

**Here is the quickest way to install the complete framework and get started:**

```
git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
conda install graphviz
cd notebooks
jupyter lab
```

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which may be installed and used separately. See the [installation guide](installation.md) for more details.

## Overview of PyEarthTools

PyEarthTools is a Python framework containing modules for:
 - loading and fetching data; 
 - pre-processing, normalising and standardising data into a normal form suitable for machine learning; 
 - defining machine learning (ML) models; 
 - training ML models and managing experiments;
 - performing inference with ML models; 
 - and evaluating ML models. 

## Overview of the Packages within PyEarthTools

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which can be used individually or together.

|    Sub-Package                                         |  Purpose  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------- |
|  [Data](api/data/data_index.md)                        | Loading and indexing into well-known Earth system data sets to produce ML-ready data structures |
|  [Utils](api/utils/utils_index.md)                     | Code for common functionality across the sub-packages |
|  [Pipeline](api/pipeline/pipeline_index.md)            | Definining reproducible sequences of operations with the ability to cache results |
|  [Training](api/training/training_index)               | Code defining the training processes and schedules of a machine learning model |
|  [Tutorial](api/tutorial/tutorial_index.md)            | Contains helper code for data data sets used in tutorials |
|  [Bundled Models](api/bundled_models/bundled_index.md) | Maintained versions of specific, bundled models which can be easily trained and run |
|  [Zoo](api/zoo/zoo_index.md)                           | Contains code for managing registered models (such as the bundled models) |
|  Evaluation                                            | (Coming soon) Contains code for producing standard evaluations (such as benchmarks and scorecards) |
