# PyEarthTools: Reproducible science pipelines for machine learning

`PyEarthTools` is a Python framework, containing modules for loading data; pre-processing, normalising and standardising data; defining machine learning (ML) models; training ML models; performing inference with ML models; and evaluating ML models. It contains specialised support for weather and climate data sources and models. It has an emphasis on reproducibility, shareable pipelines, and human-readable low-code pipeline definition.

# Getting Started

Guidelines for new users still need to be developed.
For new users, we recommend following the instructions in the [Tutorials](#tutorials) section of this README.
Installation instructions are intended for users already familiar with the project.

# Installation

## Repository Layout

This is a so-called monorepo. `PyEarthTools` comprises multiple, modular packages within a shared namespace that inter-operate in order to provide the overall functionality of the framework. It is not necessary to install all of them, and it is envisioned that many users are likely to want only some parts of the framework. As such, each sub-package is a fully independent Python package, with its own requirements and its own installation process. Each of these sub-packages lies in the [`packages`](packages/) subdirectory.

## User installation

Each of PyEarthTools package can be installed separately using `pip`, directly from GitHub.
For example, to install the `pyearthtools-utils` package, use:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git#subdirectory=packages/utils
```

Other available packages are `pyearthtools-data`, `pyearthtools-pipeline` and `pyearthtools-training`, that can be installed as follows:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git#subdirectory=packages/data
pip install git+https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git#subdirectory=packages/pipeline
pip install git+https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git#subdirectory=packages/training
```

> [!NOTE]
> When this repository is ready for wider use, the intention is to release `PyEarthTools` on PyPI and conda-forge.

## Developer installation

Developers of `PyEarthTools` will most likely want to check out the entire monorepo and work on changesets which may span sub-packages. Each sub-package is versioned separately, so bugfixes or updates in a single sub-package can be performed independently without requiring a new release of the entire ecosystem. 

First clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git
```

and install all packages in "editable" mode with

```
cd PyEarthTools
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

> [!WARNING]
> We do recommend using a Python virtual environment or a Conda environment when developing, to isolate this installation from the rest of your system.


# Tutorials

For new users, we recommend running the tutorials first, to see `PyEarthTools` in action and get familiar with it.

The following instructions assume that you have access to [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) on your system.

> [!WARNING]
> These instructions have been tested on Linux and macOS. We have not tested them on **Windows**.
> We welcome any contribution to improve this situation 🙂.

First clone this repository and switch to the tutorials folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git
cd PyEarthTools/packages/tutorial
```

Then create a Conda environment to install all dependencies:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml -p ./venv
```

Next, to run the example [notebooks](packages/tutorial/nbook/), you can either

- start a JupyterLab instance

```
conda activate ./venv
jupyter lab
```

- or install a Jupyter kernel to use in a pre-existing JupyterLab installation

```
conda activate ./venv
python -m ipykernel install --user --name PET-tutorial
```
