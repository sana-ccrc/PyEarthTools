## Installation

**Here is the quickest way to install the complete framework and get started:**

```
git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
conda install graphviz
cd notebooks
jupyter lab
```

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which may be installed and used separately. See the [installation guide](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more details.

## Overview of PyEarthTools

PyEarthTools is a Python framework containing modules for:
 - loading and fetching data; 
 - pre-processing, normalising and standardising data into a normal form suitable for machine learning; 
 - defining machine learning (ML) models; 
 - training ML models and managing experiments;
 - performing inference with ML models; 
 - and evaluating ML models. 

## Overview of the Packages within PyEarthTools

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which can be used individually or together.
